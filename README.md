# CloudTask-App

  This is my Javascript Application project for the month of October and November in Android Development Subject.
This application is compatible for iPhone6 higher. It has the features of adding new task and reminding the user for its tasks. However this app is not 100% complete because of the thick amount of time and pressure upon the deadlines of passing. 

  I am still working within this app and continue to upgrade and extend its capabilities and functions of this App. Hope you like it.
